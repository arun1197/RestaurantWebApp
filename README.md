#### And here's brief summary of this project:

```
	This is a restaurant finder app. Restaurant Finder provides an easy way to
  find the best places to eat near you. If you allow it, the app can find the
  nearest restaurants just by using the radius, keyword, latitude and longitude
  that you type in. Once you're done typing in the information, click generate
  and let it work for you!

  -radius range available 5000m to 50000m inclusive.

  -Map centers at lat lng user provided.
